# MHV-Coffee-Percolator
A project to control and publish the status of the MHV coffee percolator using an Arduino Uno. 

Hopefully this project will turn the coffee percolator on and off, indicate the level of coffee in the pot, have a photo of said pot updating to the MHV website and publish any relavent inforation to the same website. 

//Currently this will turn the the pot on and off using a relay and the industrial switch in the space. ***Yet to be tested in place***
