  Button

  Turns on and off the coffee machine connected via a relay to pin 12,
  when activating the isolation switch attached to pin 6.

  

  The circuit:
  - Relay attached from pin 6 to ground
  - Relay wired into the on off switch of the coffee machine.
  - isolation switch attached to pin 12 from +5V
  - 10K resistor attached to pin A0 from ground
  -Displays the circuit being on via LED attached to pin 13
